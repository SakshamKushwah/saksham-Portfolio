## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/types/contact.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/services/contactService.ts` - Contact form submission service
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Database setup script
- `SETUP-SUPABASE.md` - Complete setup guide
- `env.example` - Environment variables template
- `env.local.example` - Local environment template

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/ContactSection.tsx` - Enhanced with Supabase integration

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase project** following the guide in `SETUP-SUPABASE.md`
2. **Create `.env.local` file** with your Supabase credentials
3. **Run the SQL script** in your Supabase dashboard
4. **Test the contact form** by submitting a message
5. **Verify data storage** in your Supabase dashboard

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Name (min 2 chars), Email (valid format), Message (min 10 chars)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Error messages appear as you type
- **Loading States**: Button shows spinner during submission
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages with proper styling
- **Security**: Row Level Security enabled, public insert allowed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all scenarios
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the stack

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled by default
- Public insert policy for contact forms
- Authenticated view policy for data access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error messages don't expose internal details

The contact form is now fully functional and ready to store user messages in your Supabase database!
